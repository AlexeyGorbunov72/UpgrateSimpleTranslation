# UpgradeSimpleTranslation From Mobile Junior Meetup

I create a publisher and subscriber, when user type -> change variable, which listen a publisher; 
In this moment subscriber drops dublicates of requests and wait 500 milliseconds after user stop typing a text and put this string into func which work with yandex translate api, so this solution just reduce some network activity;

My contribution: publisher, subscriber; Everything else: https://github.com/goingreen
